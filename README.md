# Letterwatch

Made by **Yamnyr**

## Description

**Letterwatch** is a Chrome extension that provides easy access to a player for watching films from Letterboxd and TMDB. Hereâ€™s what the extension does:

- **Integrated Player**: Adds an integrated player on Letterboxd (`letterboxd.com`), allowing you to view films directly on the platform.
- **Discreet Play Button**: Adds a button on Letterboxd pages that directs you to a page containing the player.
- **Play Button on TMDB**: Adds a similar button on TMDB pages that directs you to a page with the player.
- **Ad Blocking**: Disables ads on Letterboxd. Some players may not work with an ad blocker, so this feature allows you to disable ads without using an ad blocker.
- **Multiple Player Options**: Whether on the separate player page or the integrated player on Letterboxd, multiple players are available in case some do not suit your needs.
